                    <p>this is how to make a panda</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Approximately 99 percent of a panda’s diet—bamboo leaves and shoots—is void of much nutritional value. Its carnivore-adapted digestive system cannot digest cellulose well, thus it lives a low-energy, sedentary lifestyle but persists in eating some 60 species of bamboo. Pandas must eat upwards of 30 pounds of bamboo daily just to stay full.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The body of a cicada is similar to that of a violin or a guitar, in that much of it consists of empty, air-filled spaces that act like a resonating chamber and amplify the sound they generate.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Well, not literally – but they can move their eyes separately, with each eye having a field of 180 degrees. This means they can see 360 degrees if they need to!</li>

                        <li>I did not know this! I just looked this up! September 9th is National Teddy Bear Day! From cuddly childhood playmates to collector's items, the Teddy Bear has worn many hats since it's inception in the early 20th century.</li>

                        <li>Camels are very strong and can carry up to 900 pounds for 25 miles a day, and camels can travel at up to 40 miles per hour – the same as a racehorse!</li>
